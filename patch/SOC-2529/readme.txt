SOC-2529: How to distinguish between my stream and my friend stream pages
What is the problem to fix?
You want to view your friend activities streams and go to this pages that contains your friend activity but you can't distinguish between my stream and my friend stream pages or activity streams of any body.

Problem analysis
Labels on left menu make users confuse where they are in. When user on his/her profile or activities page it still ok, but when others profile or activities page are viewed is not right with that labels.

How is the problem fixed?
To ignore confusing just by labels then we remove My from labels then labels are now Profile and Connections not are My Profile and My Connections as before and full user's information will be display as title only.
